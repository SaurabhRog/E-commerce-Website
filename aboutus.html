                This Project is fully created by me using technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Json, Scss etc. I have added functionality like playing songs, transitions, login & signup for validations etc using jQuery (A library built in Javascript).I have used the songs and images of the player in json format.I have styled all the pages using Scss(css preprocessor) which have functionality such as
variables, functions etc which css donâ€™t have. I will surely link backend to this wonderfulproject when I will learn it.
